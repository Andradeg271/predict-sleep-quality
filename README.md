# predict-sleep-quality
This project predicts sleep quality based on user-provided data. It generates a CSV file with the collected information and creates visualizations that compare sleep-related attributes—such as hours slept, profession, stress level, and more—over time.

To run the program correctly, you need to download the file Sleep.ipynb and upload it to Google Colab. This is necessary so the model can access a dataset to train on. After that, just run the cells in order and follow the instructions in the notebook.
